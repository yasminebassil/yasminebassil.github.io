## Experience

## NEUROSCIENCE PHD CANDIDATE · Neural Plasticity Research Lab, Emory University (Aug 2020–May 2026)

**Research Leadership & Execution:**
- Led dissertation research identifying behavioral and neural mechanisms of aging-related spatial navigation deficits, using VR, fMRI, and concurrent TMS-fMRI across 110+ recruited participants.
- Directed 15+ members of Navigation Team over 6 years (7 undergraduate, 6 doctoral students), establishing weekly meetings and tracking tasks & milestones across 8+ concurrent sub-studies.
- Established concurrent TMS-fMRI as institutional research capability through Emory's Center for Systems Imaging Core, expanding methodology access for broader Atlanta neuro community.

**Technical Infrastructure & Tools:**
- Directed build of immersive city-like VR navigation task in Unity; open-sourced on GitHub.
- Co-developed MR.Flow, a custom neuroimaging pipeline integrating fMRIPrep, FreeSurfer, and FSL with user-friendly GUI, replacing multi-step manual workflows.
- Created standardized analysis pipelines (Python, R) for Navigation Team reproducible protocols.
- Organized lab GitHub infrastructure (7 repositories), increasing accessibility of tools for internal and external researchers.
